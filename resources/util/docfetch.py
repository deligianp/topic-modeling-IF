A basic custom module that normalizes a docstring for CLI printing.

The module offers a single function for normalizing a given docstring in order to restrict its width to fit to a CLI.
In addition it attempts to maintain its morphological structure and indentation.

To achieve the above, the module makes certain assumptions.
    1. The docstring should begin either:
        * after the opening quotes
        * in any subsequent line, indented by one position to the right, in respect to the documented code entity.
    2. The docstring uses a nicely-indented form. This means that the amount of the indentation should decrease only
    when it has been prior increased. As a result, if docstring is indented more than any subsequent line, the
    indentation, will be in respect with the leftmost line.
    3. Line changes inside docstring, are used to break the docstring to separate lines. The resulting docstring
    segments are being connected automatically with a space. Thus there is no reason for docstring authors to leave a
    space before changing to a new line.

def _text_chunks(lines_list):
    """
    This function is used internally by the module.

    It infers the text chunks that their contents should be wrapped to new lines when they reach the end of CLI.

    To be able to create textual representations that can be wrapped when a line in CLI has been filled, the initial
    lines of a docstring must be concatenated together. However, this generates a new problem; there are times where
    the split in the docstring represent an actual line break rather that the author's wrapping of the docstring.

    This function aims to identify the aforementioned conditions and transform a given list of docstring lines to a
    list of chunks along with their indentation, where each chunk can be wrapped when a new line is needed. A new chunk
    is generated when:
        * the indentation changes
            e.g. The docstring
                \"\"\"
                line 0
                line 1
                    line 2
                \"\"\"
            yields the chunks [["line 0 line 1",""], ["line 2","    "]]
        * an empty line is met
            e.g. The docstring
                \"\"\"
                line 0


                line 1
                \"\"\"
            yields the chunks [["line 0",""], ["",""], ["",""], ["line 1",""]]
        * a listing item is defined
            e.g. The docstring
                \"\"\"
                line 0
                    * this is a very long line that also

                    * line 2
